# -Smart-Watering-Management-System-Using-IoT
This IoT Based Project has been designed and tested successfully. The moisture sensors measure the moisture level of the soil if the moisture level is found to be below than desired level, the moisture sensor sends the signal to Arduino UNO board which triggers the Water Pump turn ON and supply water using DC Motor. And automatically turns OFF.
